<!-- BEGINNING OF PRE-COMMIT-TERRAFORM DOCS HOOK -->
Creates an ALB for serving a web app.

Creates the following resources:

* ALB with separate target groups for HTTP and HTTPS.
* Security Groups for the ALB.

The HTTPS listener uses an Amazon certificate.

## Usage

```hcl
module "app_alb" {
  source = "../../modules/aws-alb-web-service"

  name           = "app"
  environment    = "prod"
  logs_s3_bucket = "my-aws-logs"

  alb_vpc_id             = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  alb_subnet_ids         = "${module.vpc.public_subnets}"
  alb_health_check_path  = "/health"
}
```
